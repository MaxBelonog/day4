                I was born in New Jersey and moved to Chicago at a young age, and lived there for a time before moving to California and finishing middle and high School. In my free time outside of school, I enjoy tinkering with computers and reading books. I attended Moorpark College and have 2 years completed there with a career path of Journalism, but later realized that I liked computers a lot more and decided to persue something more fulfilling to my interests.

                I was born in Utah and moved to San Diego at a young age. I spent most of my life here in San Diego. I have played soccer for 17 years and coached for 6. Recently I took an interest in everything computers, from building PCs to learning how to code. I attended San Diego State University for two years before injuring my leg playing soccer. I also took a handful of courses at Grossmont Community College to attempt to finish my associate's degree.
